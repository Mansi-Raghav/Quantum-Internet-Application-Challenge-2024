# Quantum-Internet-Application-Challenge-2024
My idea for Quantum Internet Application Challenge 2024 is to make a Quantum Token. It is similar to the idea of Quantum money, though I have used some variations at few places to see if it can work in SquidASM. I will be explaining the idea in detail and then will move to its applications.

# Overview
Quantum token system is prepared leveraging quantum internet capabilities for enhanced security and one-time use authentication. The system is inspired by quantum money schemes but designed for practical use in services that require highly secure, tamper-proof, and unique tokens. Each quantum token consists of:
1. Serial Number (s): A unique, publicly known identifier.
2. Quantum State (|ψ⟩): A quantum state tied to the serial number through a pseudorandom function.

# System Components
1. Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG):
It uses the fundamental unpredictability of quantum mechanics (e.g., measurements of quantum states like photon polarization or phase) to generate random values. The output is fundamentally random and not based on any mathematical assumptions about the difficulty of certain computational tasks.
A QRNG generated key k is kept secret and will be used to link the serial number  with a unique quantum state.
2. Pseudorandom Function f:
This function will take the serial number s and the key k, and deterministically outputs a sequence of random-looking bits. This output is used to determine the quantum state.
3. Quantum State Generation:
The quantum state ∣ψ⟩ for a serial number s is generated using f(s). The bit string generated by f(s) can be used to determine the basis (computational or Hadamard) and the state for each qubit in ∣ψ⟩. The quantum state is securely transmitted to the user.
4. Verification Mechanism:
Upon token submission, the authority measures the quantum state in the correct basis derived from the key k and s. If measurement results match expected outcomes, the token is valid; otherwise, it is rejected and destroyed.

# Step-by-Step Implementation
1. Token Issuance

1. Secret Key Generation:
   - A random secret key k is generated using QRNG. This key is securely stored by the issuing authority.
   - Example: Let k = 100011

2. Serial Number Assignment:
   - Each token is assigned a unique, publicly visible serial number s.
   - Example: Let s = 101010

3. Quantum State Generation:
   - Using, a pseudorandom output is produced based on k and s.
   - Example: f(s) = f(101010) = 000011000011
   - This output determines the quantum state, prepared in a specific basis.
   - Example: 0s refers to computation basis (i.e. |0⟩, |1⟩) and 1s refers to hadamard basis (i.e. |+⟩, |-⟩). And hence an unkown quantum state can be formed.

4. Token Delivery:
   - The token, containing s and ∣ψ⟩, is delivered to the user.

2. Token Verification

1. Token Submission:
   - The user submits the token for verification to the authority bearing s and ∣ψ⟩.

2. Basis Reconstruction:
   - The authority computes the basis for measurement of the quantum state using s from the token and k that they already have to recommute f(s). This will tell them basis of measurement.

3. Quantum State Measurement:
   - The quantum state  is measured in the reconstructed basis. And measurement outcomes are compared against expected results to verify the token.

4. Validation and Outcome:
   - If results match, the token is valid, and the service is granted. And if results do not match, the token is invalidated and cannot be reused.
   
# Advantages

1. High Security:
   - Quantum states cannot be cloned (No-Cloning Theorem).
   - Tokens are unique and tamper-proof due to quantum mechanics.
2. One-Time Use:
   - Tokens are destroyed upon verification, reducing the risk of reuse or replication.
3. Decentralization Ready:
   - Easily adaptable to decentralized systems leveraging quantum internet for secure communication and entanglement distribution.

# Potential Use Cases

1. Access Control: Secure one-time entry tokens for sensitive facilities.
2. Digital Payments: Highly secure transactions using quantum tokens as a payment method.
3. Data Sharing: One-time secure access to confidential files or resources.
